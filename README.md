## About

This is my **personal hacking workstation**, built to be efficient, focused, and visually inspired by the **HackTheBox aesthetic**.

It's tailored for:
- Red teaming
- HTB machines & challenges
- Terminal-based workflow
- Full customization over Tmux, Polybar, and Picom

I use this environment daily to **break into boxes, write payloads, and automate attack vectors**.

## Features

-  **Polybar** with custom workspace module and neon border styling
-  **Picom** with rounded corners + kawase blur
-  **Tmux** with vibrant HUD-style statusline
-  **Zsh** with Nerd Fonts and Powerlevel10k
-  Transparent + futuristic terminal layout
-  Fast, lightweight, made for real ops
